Data Cleansing on Food Inspections Data for Health and Human Services
This information is derived from inspections of restaurants and other food establishments in Chicago from January 1, 2010 to the present. Inspections are performed by staff 
from the Chicago Department of Public Healthâ€™s Food Protection Program using a standardized procedure. The results of the inspection are inputted into a database, then
reviewed and approved by a State of Illinois Licensed Environmental Health Practitioner (LEHP).

Disclaimer: Attempts have been made to minimize any and all duplicate inspection reports. However, the dataset may still contain such duplicates and the appropriate 
precautions should be exercised when viewing or analyzing these data.
